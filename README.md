# Fallout Style Command Terminal
- There are countless fallout maps on minecraft but something (to me) is missing. Terminals!
- These lua based scripts give you the feel of the terminals you'd find in fallout 4 (or others, yet to start new vegas)
- not only do these provide a look and feeling but I aim to make these terminals functional too! Also supports Windows but features will be severely limited.
- All of my fallout terminals aim to feel as though these scripts were made by Vault-Tec engineers. Most of the scripts provide hidden modes, secrets and much more. Intended for the overseer, but prone to many vulnerabilities
- Take a look around, instructions are to come soon. If you'd like to help I'd appreciate it!

This will be in development for a long while, every version will strive to not have any bugs.
